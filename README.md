It is designed for developers who need a reliable starting point for building lightweight sites without the overhead of a heavy framework.
# Static Multi-Page Boilerplate

A lightweight, multi-page HTML/CSS template with consistent navigation and shared styling.

## Project Structure
- index.html, about.html, contact.html: Core content pages.
- css/style.css: Shared global stylesheet.

## Usage
1. Navigation: Every page uses a shared nav block. 
2. Active State: Update the class="active" on the current page link to highlight it in the UI.
3. Linking: Uses relative paths for cross-page compatibility.

## Global Styling
Edit css/style.css to apply site-wide changes to the layout, typography, or the navigation highlight.
